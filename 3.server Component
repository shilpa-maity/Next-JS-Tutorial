page.tsx is server component . you can not use hooks here.


export default function Home(){
const[click,setClick]=useState(0);
  return(
    <div className="grid grid-rows-[20px_1fr_20px] items-center">
      <h1>This is our homepage at root route/root level</h1>
    </div>
    );
}

//it is root directory which is inside app
//it will throw error
